## Introduction
The notebook is designed to analyze solar energy data, clean it for inconsistencies, and build predictive models to estimate solar energy output based on various features. This analysis aids in understanding patterns in solar energy production and supports data-driven decision-making.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration using Pandas.
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn).
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Machine learning models for prediction:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - XGBoost Regression
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
